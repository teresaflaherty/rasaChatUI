# Rasa Chat UI

This is the repository for a simple frontend using Teresa Flaherty's modified version of the Rasa Open Source Engine (the modifications add emotional capabilities to the bot). The Chat UI has a simple message interface allowing the user to speak through both text and voice and provides the option of using Gabriel Denys' Emotional State Emulator to provide emotional context within the bot. 

The UI is hooked up to a prebuilt Rasa model which showcases the bot's emotional capabilities, but can be customized to connect to any Rasa model. 
The UI assumes the user has a locally running instance of both the Rasa model and the Emotional Emulator.
